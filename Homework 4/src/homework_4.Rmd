## Problem 1a: 
\textbf{Load the data and create two ppp objects from it, one for affected and one for unaffected individuals. A key question is: what is the window? It is not available for this data. For now, take the window to be the same for each ppp object: use a rectangular region based on the range of x and y for both datasets. (Have a look at the help file for owin.)}
```{r 1a, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#load the data
grave_dat <- read.table("C:/Users/ckell/OneDrive/Penn State/2017-2018/597/spatial_statistics_597/Homework 4/data/dental.reduced.dat", header=FALSE)
#ignore the first column
grave_dat <- grave_dat[,-1]
#label the variables
colnames(grave_dat) <- c("indicator", "x", "y")

#affected dataset
aff_dat <- grave_dat[which(grave_dat$indicator == 1),]
#unaffected dataset
unaff_dat <- grave_dat[which(grave_dat$indicator == 0),]

#what window to use? for now, take the window to be the same for each ppp object
#     the window will be a rectangular region based on the range of x and y for both datasets
window <- owin(xrange = range(grave_dat$x), yrange = range(grave_dat$y))

#create ppp object- affected individuals
aff_ppp <- as.ppp(aff_dat[,c(2:3)], W = window)

#create ppp object- unaffected individuals
unaff_ppp <- as.ppp(unaff_dat[,c(2:3)], W = window)


# #what it is supposed to be like
# data(cells)
# 
# E <- envelope(cells, Kest, nsim =100, nrank = 10, global = TRUE)
# plot(E)

```

## Problem 1b: 
\textbf{For each dataset separately, create Monte Carlo simulation envelopes for the F and G functions and plot them. Clearly label your plots and turn in a few sentences describing any choices you made in creating the envelopes. Is their evidence against CSR in this dataset? If so, what type of violation is suggested?}

I have included my plots below for the F and G functions for both datasets. 

Choices I made in creating the envelopes:
Evidence against CSR in the dataset: 
What kind of violation:

```{r 1b, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#creating MC sim envelope for affected dataset
#    F function
f_aff <- envelope(aff_ppp, fun = Fest, global = TRUE)
plot(f_aff, main = "F function Envelope, Affected Population")
#    G function
g_aff <- envelope(aff_ppp, fun = Gest, global = TRUE)
plot(g_aff, main = "G function Envelope, Affected Population")

#creating MC sim envelope for unaffected dataset
#    F function
f_aff <- envelope(unaff_ppp, nrank = 10,fun = Fest, global = TRUE)
plot(f_aff, main = "F function Envelope, Unaffected Population")
#    G function
g_aff <- envelope(unaff_ppp, fun = Gest, global = TRUE)
plot(g_aff, main = "G function Envelope, Unaffected Population")

```

## Problem 1c: 
\textbf{Now let's consider a more likely window: that these graves represent a complete excavation of the area in which they appear, and that area is irregularly shaped. Since we don't know what it is, we can choose a rough polygon outline to surround the points. You can create such an outline by plotting the locations and using the locator function; again, see help(owin) for the details of how to specify a polygon boundary. Create two new ppp objects with this new window.}
```{r 1c, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
# help(owin)
# help(locator)

# plot(w)
#  # plots edges of a box 1 unit x 2 units
#  v <- locator() 
#  # click on points in the plot window
#  # to be the vertices of a polygon 
#  # traversed in anticlockwise order 
#  u <- owin(c(0,1), c(0,2), poly=v)

#create polygons - affected individuals
plot(aff_dat[,c(2,3)])
aff_poly <- locator()

#create polygons - affected individuals
plot(unaff_dat[,c(2,3)])
unaff_poly <- locator()

save(aff_poly, unaff_poly, file = "C:/Users/ckell/OneDrive/Penn State/2017-2018/597/spatial_statistics_597/Homework 4/data/polygon_dat.Rdata")

```

```{r 1cb, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
load(file = "C:/Users/ckell/OneDrive/Penn State/2017-2018/597/spatial_statistics_597/Homework 4/data/polygon_dat.Rdata")


#create ppp object- affected individuals
poly_window_aff <- owin( poly = aff_poly)
aff_ppp_poly <- as.ppp(aff_dat[,c(2:3)], W = poly_window_aff)

#create ppp object- unaffected individuals
poly_window_unaff <- owin(poly = unaff_poly)
unaff_ppp_poly <- as.ppp(unaff_dat[,c(2:3)], W = poly_window_unaff)

```

## Problem 1d: 
\textbf{Repeat step (b) for the new datasets. What changes? Can you explain
the reason for this, based on the form of the test statistics?}

What changes? Can you explain
the reason for this, based on the form of the test statistics?

```{r 1d, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#creating MC sim envelope for affected dataset
#    F function
f_aff <- envelope(aff_ppp_poly, fun = Fest, global = TRUE)
plot(f_aff, main = "F function Envelope, Affected Population")
#    G function
g_aff <- envelope(aff_ppp_poly, fun = Gest, global = TRUE)
plot(g_aff, main = "G function Envelope, Affected Population")



#creating MC sim envelope for unaffected dataset
#    F function
f_aff <- envelope(unaff_ppp_poly, nrank = 10,fun = Fest, global = TRUE)
plot(f_aff, main = "F function Envelope, Unaffected Population")
#    G function
g_aff <- envelope(unaff_ppp_poly, fun = Gest, global = TRUE)
plot(g_aff, main = "G function Envelope, Unaffected Population")

```

## Problem 2: 
\textbf{Simulate four datasets on the unit square, from a homogeneous Poisson process
with a rate $\lambda$ of your choosing. For each one, fit a kernel estimate of the
intensity function and plot it with the points overlaid. What do you conclude
about interpreting the results of this estimator? In other words, what can go
wrong if we fit a spatial point process model without checking for CSR first?}
```{r 2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#homogenous Poisson Process space and rate
x0=0;x1=1;y0=0;y1=1
lambda0<- 300
par(mfrow= c(1,2))

for(i in 1:4){
  #Simulating for number of events in the rectangle
  n.event=rpois(1,lambda0)
  
  #calculate x and y
  x.i=runif(n.event,min=x0,max=x1)
  y.i=runif(n.event,min=y0,max=y1)
  
  dat <- cbind(x.i, y.i)
  dat <- as.data.frame(dat)
  
  #Plot Homogenous Poisson Process
  #plot(dat,xlim=c(0,1), main=expression(paste("Uniform Method on D when intensity = ", lambda[0]," = 300")))
  
  #what window to use? for now, take the window to be the same for each ppp object
  #     the window will be a rectangular region of the unit square (0,1)x(0,1)
  window <- owin(xrange = c(0,1), yrange = c(0,1))
  
  
  #create ppp object- affected individuals
  dat_ppp <- as.ppp(dat, W = window)
  
  plot(density.ppp(dat_ppp), main = expression(paste("Kernel estimate with Uniform \nMethod on (0,1)x(0,1) when intensity = ", lambda, " = 300")))
  points(dat,xlim=c(0,1))
}

```


## Problem 3: 
\textbf{Read through sections 15.2 and 15.3 of the notes by Adrian Baddeley about
fitting point process models in R with the spatstat package (you can find it
on Canvas).
In 15.3, follow along with the R code example for the bei dataset. In particular,
find the MLEs for inhomogeneous models with intensity functions:}
$$ \text{Model 1: } = exp\{\beta_0 + \beta_1 Z(x)\} $$
$$\text{Model 2: }  = \beta Z(x)$$

\textbf{Plot a kernel density estimate of $\lambda(x)$, ignoring covariates, as well as the fitted intensities under the two models. Put them all on the same color scale, and include a sentence or two comparing them. Note: the data for this problem are available from the spatstat package.}
